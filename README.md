# gooseISO
**âš  There's no support given for anything inside of this repository.**

My personal presets and scripts to modify Windows 10 21H2 with NTLite, you would need to edit this for your own use.

### Why is this public?
Maybe someone could find it useful, maybe someone could steal something from here like a small tweak for their own modification or own customisations. No credits need to be given by the way.

### Why not use duckISO?
This is temporary pretty much, until duckISO is finished and there's an easy to use utility.

### Credits
- [AtlasOS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas) - Basically just a fork of Atlas with my own stuff.
