# gooseISO
**âš  There's no support given for anything inside of this repository.**

My personal ISO with personal tweaks, you need to edit this for your own use.

### Why is this public?
Maybe someone could find it useful, maybe someone could steal something from here like a small tweak for their own ISO or own customisations. No credits need to be given by the way.
