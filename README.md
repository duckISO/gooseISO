My personal presets and scripts to modify Windows 11 with NTLite for performance and privacy. GooseISO is a fork of [AtlasOS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas). It is focused on being a long term installation, with not a lot of items stripped (mostly UWP bloat is stripped), causing less issues in the future as you can re-enable what you have disabled.
- Defender is not stripped, but it is disabled by default
  - You may want or need it in the future, it is a good anti-virus that integrates into Windows well (your brain is better though mostly)
- Windows Update is not disabled, it is configured with policies and you can easily re-run the post installation script after an update
  - It is enabled for security and bug fixes (it is Windows 11 after all)
- Edge (configued with policies) is not stripped, it can be uninstalled and replaced with either LibreWolf of Brave
  - Couldn't strip it easily with free NTLite, plus it is nice to have an included web browser

### There are no ISOs provided
If you want to use this, [build it yourself](https://github.com/he3als/gooseISO/src). This is to avoid noobs using it and asking for help with simple things that they shouldn't need help for if they are knowingly using a custom ISO.
